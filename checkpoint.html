		<h2>Project Checkpoint</h2>
		<hr />
		<h3>Main Logic</h3>
		<h4>Game Board Setup</h4>
		<p>The game board is created using form information provided by the user. This gathers the size and color of the game board. Currently the board takes this information creats card pairs of 1-n and scatters them across the board.</p>
		<h4>User Logic</h4>
		<p>The code to keep track of user turns is in place. This keeps track of how many turns the user has taken, how many pairs they have found, and the time in which it took to find them.</p>
		<h4>View Logic</h4>
		<p>The view code is in place to gather information from the board's controller, translate it into a 2d array, and then print that 2d array as cards to the screen. Addclick handlers have been established, and function to reveal the card number when clicked.</p>
		<h3>Remaining Logic</h3>
		<h4>Turn Logic</h4>
		<p>The code to execute a turn needs to be established. If a user finds a match, both cards should stay face up and the User's pair variable incremented. If the two cards chosen are not a match, the cards should show the numbers for a few seconds, then revert back to being face down.
		</p>
		<h4>End of Game Logic</h4>
		<p>The logic needs to be written to determine when the end of a game has been met, then alert the user. This can be done by comparing the number of pairs found, compared to the total number of cards/2. When these values are equal, the game has ended.

	<h3>What is Concentration?</h2>
		<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_%28game%29" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>, Concentration is...</p>
		<p> a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. Concentration can be played with any number of players or as solitaire and is an especially good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well. The scheme is often used in quiz shows and can be employed as an educational game.</p>
		<h3>Rules of Concentration</h3>

			<li>A deck of cards is laid face-down into and 8x8 square.</li>
			<li>Each player takes a turn flipping two cards over.</li>
			<li>If the two cards chosen are a matching pair, the player keeps those cards</li>
			<li>If the two cards are not a matching pair, the player returns the cards face-down to their original position, and the next turn begins.</li>
